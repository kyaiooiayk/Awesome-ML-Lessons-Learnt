# Awesome-ML-Lessons-Learnt
*A list of lesson learnt ot things to watch out for in the Data Science and Machine Learning worlds*
***

## Lessons learnt
- Don't assume the data is available.
- Don't assume the data is easy to get.
- Don't assume that the labels are perfect (human bias while labelling).
- Don't fail to start over and reassess when you realise the project is going in weird directions.
- Don't fail to connect model's objective and the way the model might be used.
- Don't fail to appreciate the core of the problem could effectively be predicting something way bigger and more complex.
- Put usability and production needs before model accuracy and not viceversa.
- Don't start the ML project until you agreed on the scope with the client. Otherwise, the client may move the goalpost later.
- Don't touch the model until you understand what the real KPI for the business are.
- Don't start modelling unless you have performed a thoroughly EDA!
- Don't train the model on the entire data. Split into train, valid, test. Fit your model on train, optimize on valid, and measure on test.
- Don't toss too many uncorrelated and unnecessary features. Reduce, reduce, reduce down to the essentials!
- Don't celebrate too early. Watch out for data leakage and overfitted model.
- In fraud modeling, AUC is not the only metric that matters. You have to consider what is the fraud loss in $ and lifetime value $ lost should you ban the wrong user.
- In a recommender system, CTR or NDCG is not the only metric that matters. You have to consider candidate diversity, feedback bias, and $ monetization generated from purchases or Ads
